# Building Characteristics estimation -  Determination of the most promising set of temporal features 

This repository will include (after the review process is completed) the utilized processed data, the obtained optimal set of features (for each considered target target) and the implemented feature selection procedures of the following paper:
Building Characterization through Smart Meter Data Analytics:Determination of the Most Influential Temporal andImportance-in-prediction based Features, currently under-review in Journal of Energy and Buildings- 

The provided feature selection procedures permit repearing the process with a new dataset (including more buildings, other type of classes or even other targets) and obtaining the resulting set of selected features.
